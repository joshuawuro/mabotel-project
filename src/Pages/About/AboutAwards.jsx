            Wassaman Youth Excellence Awards (WYEAs) is a prestigious initiative
            by the Mabotel Honours Network aimed at recognizing and celebrating
            the outstanding achievements of young individuals between the ages
            of 16 and 38 in the Wassaman region. Our mission is to highlight the
            exceptional contributions of youth in various fields such as
            academics, sports, arts, entrepreneurship, and community service. By
            honoring these young achievers, we aspire to inspire the next
            generation to strive for excellence and make meaningful
            contributions to society.
